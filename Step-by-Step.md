First I created a file called index.html and a file called script.js to test the response obtained from the API's endpoint URL provided.

After defining an async function to fetch the data and dealing with the Promise's state handlers, I was able to print the data obtained in the console (testing using the 'console.log' function).

Then I decided to create an app using React framework, because I had done a similar project before this way, that project was called 'Jammming' (you can find it at: https://github.com/vinioliveira-dev/Jammming).

After creating the app, first thing I did was deleting all unecessary files and boilerplate generated by the 'create-react-app' command. Then I tweaked the 'index.html' file inside the /public directory to customize it a bit to this project (adding google fonts, changing page title, adding css/reset, et cetera).

At this point, my next step was to start creating components. I've only done a simple wireframe in a piece of paper, which gave me an ideia of what components I would need to build. 

I started by creating a directory called "/Components" inside the app's /src folder. In this new directory, I created the folders for each of the __ components, which are:
- App directory (to where I moved my App.js and app.css files from the /src folder);
- ...;
- ...;

So I began working on the App component, refactoring it to rewrite the function component as a ES6 Class to make it easier to work with the lifecycle methods and the app's state instead of using hooks callbacks.
